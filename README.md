===================
Helio is an instant messenger. It aims to be simple, quick and user-intuitive. I developed this in the Summer of 2016 and after then has not been actively maintained.
The back-end is programmed in [Python](https://www.python.org/) and serves the clients using [Json](http://www.json.org/).
There are two clients avaliable: 
* Mobile (Cordova) 
* Windows (WPF)
